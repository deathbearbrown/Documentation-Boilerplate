      <h4>Open Source is more than code</h4>
      <p>
        Open source is community.  We want to make tools for each other and we want them to be useful.
        We want others to have the agency to use these tools and to improve them.  We want people to feel welcome, to be informed, and to know the vision we have for our projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        This theme was made to be a boilerplate not just for making a pretty github pages site with documentation, but to be a boilerplate for what you need to start a community.  To think about
        your project not just as some code you maintain, but as something that has the capacity to grow
        and evolve over time with the help of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Look at your projects as having at least 2 users: developers and the people who will use what the developer makes with your code.
      </p>
      <p>
        For developers, write your code with documentation and tests.  Have clear community guidelines, contributing guidelines and easy ways to onboard into the project. Take the anxiety out of making a first PR.
      </p>
      <p>
        Define the person you are building your project for. What problems does it solve for them? what does this look like in production? Who needs this? What can make this even better? We often don't think about all the work that goes into Design when writing code. Doing so will only make better projects with clear goals.
