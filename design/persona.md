Personas are fictional, archetypal characters that represent the users of an application. They help us see a design from new perspectives, make decisions, and uncover blind spots.

For the Lyra project, the original focus was on the super user. Examples were complex visualizations such as [Napolean's March to Moscow](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/projects/lyra/app/#?example=napoleon).  While impressive, the lack of attention to new users who were not technical made it difficult to grow the userbase.

Personas come from data that you collect. For Lyra2, we interviewed students, data visualization engineers, and data visualization journalists to come up with 3 core users of the app.  From that starting point we decided to focus on Journalists and Contributors.  People who have little experience with programming their own visualizations and people who would be interested in volunteering their time and code to the project.

It might seem obvious that Contributors should be considered in an open source project, but too many projects exist that are undocumented, untested, and lack clear focus about the desired use of the product. All of these things inhibit onboarding into a new codebase.

New personas can be added as the project matures. If you are interested in created new personas use this [markdown template](/persona-template).
