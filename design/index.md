## Lyra Open Web Design

Learning from Lyra v1.0, this Lyra project is making  User Experience a main component of the application design process.

We are including the design documents so you know where we came from, who we think our users are and what terms we are thinking about as we develop the Lyra app.

Just like code, all of these design assets are living documents ment to be iterated on.  If you'd like to help with User Experience on the Lyra project, please read our contributing guidelines.
