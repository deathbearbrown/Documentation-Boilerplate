Journey mapping is way to plan the direction of your project based on the user data you collected and the personas created from that. They can be used to plan for scenarios where a user will interact with your application, and also identify existing frustration points they may be having.

The process includes documenting the following:

- *The lens:* which [persona(s)](/persona) you’re mapping, and what their scenario is

- *Touchpoints:* moments where your user interacts with your application

- *Channels:* where those interactions happen—online, over the phone, or elsewhere

- *Actions:* what people are doing to meet their needs

- *Thoughts:* how people frame their experience and define their expectations

- *Feelings:* the emotions people have along their journey— including both highs and lows

Typically when you do this exercise, people break out the post it notes. Having distributed teams makes these exercises more of a challenge for collaborating.  Simply iterating on a bulleted list or using cards in Trello can create a similar experience for remote team members.
